# OPS445 Lab 3 – Functions and System Commands

Welcome to OPS445 Lab 3!

In this lab, you will deepen your Python programming skills by learning how to create and use functions. Functions allow you to organize code into reusable blocks, making programs easier to maintain and debug. You’ll also practice running system commands from within Python, bridging your programming skills with Linux administration tasks.

📚 Lab Objectives:
+ Understand the purpose and benefits of functions in Python
+ Define and call simple functions that:
  - Work with strings
  - Work with integers
+ Learn how to import functions from other files
+ Provide functions with arguments and return values
+ Build smarter functions that combine logic and reusability
+ Run system commands from Python programs
+ Submit evidence of your work through organized scripts and logs

📂 Lab Files:
You will create and work with the following files during this lab:
+ lab3a.py – Simple functions with strings
+ lab3b.py – Simple functions with integers
+ lab3c.py – Importing functions
+ lab3d.py – Functions with arguments
+ lab3e.py – Functions returning values
+ lab3f.py – Smarter functions combining logic
+ lab3g.py – Running system commands from Python

🧩 Tips & Tricks:
+ Always start function definitions with the def keyword and indent the code properly.
+ Use descriptive names for functions to make your code easier to read and maintain.
+ Test functions individually before integrating them into larger programs.
+ Compare Python’s ability to run system commands with Bash scripting to understand differences.
+ Keep functions small and focused—avoid writing “mega-functions” that do too much.
